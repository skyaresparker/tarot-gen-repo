# Tarot Generator

Generates a 3 card tarot spread with readings
Reads both upright and reverse cards

Some upgrades:

1. User should be able to select a different tarot spread than the 3 card spread
2. Update the 'readings' to be more elaborate with more information on the cards
3. Integrate the user's name, allowing them to get a truly 'personalized' reading
4. update the UI to become fully responsive
